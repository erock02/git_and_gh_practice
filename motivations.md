Family: main reason for changing my career. I hope to have a career that allows me to support my family and be a role model for my brother and nephews. Also a career that allows remote work so I can be with there with and for my family.
Myself: I am a very technical person. I've always been more interested in the tech side of my jobs, so I want to get qualified to do a tech position.
